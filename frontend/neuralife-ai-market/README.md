## 🎯 Why NeuraLife Matters

| Audience                     | Problem                                                              | NeuraLife Solution                                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🎓 Students & Developers** | Academic AI/ML projects rarely reach real users or generate revenue. | A marketplace that turns projects into monetized, real-world products. |
| **🏢 Businesses**            | Custom AI automation is complex and expensive.                       | Affordable, tailor-made AI agents with support and maintenance.        |
| **💼 Recruiters & HRs**      | Resumes don’t prove real technical ability.                          | Live agent portfolios showcasing proven AI development skills.         |
