## 🎯 What is an AI Agent?

Unlike a traditional LLM that only responds to prompts, an AI Agent can **reason, plan, and act** to achieve a goal. It's a system that operates in a continuous loop:

> **Thought → Action → Observation → Thought...**

This allows agents to tackle complex tasks like conducting research, managing projects, or automating business workflows.

    A[Goal] --> B(Agent);
    B --"1. Thought"--> C{Reasoning};
    C --"2. Action"--> D[Use Tool e.g., Search];
    D --"3. Observation"--> E[Get Result];
    E --> B;
